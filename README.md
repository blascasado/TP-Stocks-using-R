# TP-Stocks-using-R
Final Project of Operations Research 2 course @UBA as part of my Engineering degree

You may find attached the .pdf document of the Project instructions, the .pdf document eith a brief explanation of the followed steps, the R language code script (), the .csv files () and the output file of running the code in .csv ()

The objective of this project was to design a model to determine the optimal way of managing the stock inventory of different products in a warehouse. The output result of the model was a list of the products IDs with their optimal ROP (Reorder point) and Q (quantity ordered). The variables considered where the Lead times of each product and the different costs involved (storage cost, order cost and cost of no stock). initially a regression model was proposed having great results and after the model improved its results by adding a rolling mean.
